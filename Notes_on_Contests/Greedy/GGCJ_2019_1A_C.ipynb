    "## [Alien Rhyme](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/codejam/round/0000000000051635/0000000000104e05)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Problem\n",
    "- During some extraterrestrial exploration, you found evidence of alien poetry! Your team of linguists has determined that each word in the alien language has an accent on exactly one position (letter) in the word; the part of the word starting from the accented letter is called the accent-suffix. Two words are said to rhyme if both of their accent-suffixes are equal. For example, the words PROL and TARPOL rhyme if the accented letter in both is the O or the L, but they do not rhyme if the accented letters are the Rs, or the R in PROL and the P in TARPOL, or the O in PROL and the L in TARPOL.\n",
    "\n",
    "- You have recovered a list of N words that may be part of an alien poem. Unfortunately, you do not know which is the accented letter for each word. You believe that you can discard zero or more of these words, assign accented letters to the remaining words, and then arrange those words into pairs such that each word rhymes only with the other word in its pair, and with none of the words in other pairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- You want to know the largest number of words that can be arranged into pairs in this way.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Input\n",
    "- The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, T. T test cases follow. Each test case starts with a line with a single integer N. Then, N lines follow, each of which contains a string Wi of uppercase English letters, representing a distinct word. Notice that the same word can have different accentuations in different test cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Output\n",
    "- For each test case, output one line containing Case #x: y, where x is the test case number (starting from 1) and y is the size of the largest subset of words meeting the criteria described above.\n",
