    "## [Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-common-subsequence/)\n",
    "- Given 2 strings s1 and s2, return the length of their longest common subsequence.\n",
    "- A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string\n",
    "    + with some characters(can be none) deleted \n",
    "    + and without changing the relative order of the remaining characters\n",
    "- Eg: \"ace\" is a subsequence of \"abcde\" while \"aec\" is not\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: s1 = \"abcde\", s2 = \"ace\" \n",
    "Output: 3  \n",
    "Explanation: The longest common subsequence is \"ace\" and its length is 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: s1 = \"abc\", s2 = \"abc\"\n",
    "Output: 3\n",
    "Explanation: The longest common subsequence is \"abc\" and its length is 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: s1 = \"abc\", s2 = \"def\"\n",
    "Output: 0\n",
    "Explanation: There is no such common subsequence, so the result is 0.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "```cpp\n",
    "class LongestCommonSubsequence {\n",
    "public:\n",
    "    vector<vector<int>> dp;\n",
    "    int longestCommonSubsequence(string &s1, string &s2) {\n",
    "        int N1 = s1.size();\n",
    "        int N2 = s2.size();\n",
    "        dp.assign(N1+1, vector<int>(N2+1, 0));\n",
    "\n",
    "        for(int x1=0;x1<N1;++x1) for(int x2=0;x2<N2;++x2) {\n",
    "            if(s1[x1] == s2[x2]) dp[x1+1][x2+1] = dp[x1][x2]+1;\n",
    "            else dp[x1+1][x2+1] = max(dp[x1+1][x2], dp[x1][x2+1]);\n",
    "        }\n",
    "        return dp[N1][N2];\n",
    "    }\n",
    "};\n",
    "```"
