    "# [Longest Common Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-common-subsequence/)\n",
    "- Given 2 strings s1 and s2, return the length of their longest common subsequence.\n",
    "- A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string\n",
    "    + with some characters(can be none) deleted \n",
    "    + and without changing the relative order of the remaining characters\n",
    "- Eg: `ace` is a subsequence of `abcde` while `aec` is not\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: s1 = \"abcde\", s2 = \"ace\" \n",
    "Output: 3  \n",
    "Explanation: The longest common subsequence is \"ace\" and its length is 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: s1 = \"abc\", s2 = \"abc\"\n",
    "Output: 3\n",
    "Explanation: The longest common subsequence is \"abc\" and its length is 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: s1 = \"abc\", s2 = \"def\"\n",
    "Output: 0\n",
    "Explanation: There is no such common subsequence, so the result is 0.\n",
    "```\n",
