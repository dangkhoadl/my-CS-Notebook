    "# Problem\n",
    "- N windows which provide the tickets to get entry into a park\n",
    "    + There are A[i] people already queue at each window\n",
    "    + Each window gives ticket to one person in one minute.\n",
    "- Initially, John stands in front of the first window\n",
    "    + After each minute, if he didn’t get the ticket, he moves on to the next window\n",
    "    + If he is at window 1, he will move to 2\n",
    "    + If at 2nd, he will move to 3rd\n",
